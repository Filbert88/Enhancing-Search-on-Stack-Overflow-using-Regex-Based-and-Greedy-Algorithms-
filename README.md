![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Filbert88/StackOverflow-Search-Enhancer)

## Overview
The Stack Overflow Search Enhancer is a sophisticated tool designed to improve the search functionality on Stack Overflow. It integrates advanced algorithms to handle a wide range of user queries efficiently, from precise matches to queries containing typographical errors.

## Features
- **Algorithms**: 
  - **Regular Expressions (Regex)**:
   This project uses regular expressions to identify patterns within the text and to generate variations of the search terms. This is crucial for handling queries with potential spelling errors or slight deviations from standard terminology used on Stack Overflow.

  - **Greedy Algorithm**:
    The greedy algorithm is employed to rank the fetched questions based on their relevance and user engagement metrics. It ensures that the most relevant questions appear at the top of the search results, enhancing user experience by providing the most applicable answers quickly.

  - **Levenshtein Distance (LD)**:
    The Levenshtein Distance algorithm is utilized to measure the difference between two strings. This feature is particularly useful for correcting typographical errors in the user's query, ensuring that even inaccurately entered searches can lead to accurate and helpful results.
